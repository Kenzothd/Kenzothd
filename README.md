## Check out my recent work:

[ShoeDog](https://shoedog.vercel.app/) üëüüìä (In progress) <br>
Have you considered using an e-commerce marketplace built with statistical data to track your favourite pair of shoes? ShoeDog is a website where shoe aficionados may purchase and sell shoes. It offers real-time data, alert prompts, and the ability to keep track of the status of a favourite pair of shoes.

[IDealify](https://idealify.vercel.app/) üè† <br>
Remodel your house in confidence. IDealify was built to establish trust between homeowners and interior designers. It is a one-stop project management tool which enables both parties to monitor the task at hand.

This project exposed me to working with real-world teams with various software engineers to turn concepts into functionality.

[Nifty Stats](https://niftystats.vercel.app/) üìä
<br >
An NFT web application tool to track NFT collection statistics. Statistics feature a variety of information, including the top collections based on volume, the most recent sale transaction, the largest market capitalization, and an updated Ethereum gas tracker (gwei).

[Exploding Kittens Card Game](https://exploding-kittens-card-game.vercel.app/) üÉè
<br >
Exploding Kittens is a highly strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Basically, if you draw an Exploding Kitten, you lose and you are full of loser sad-sauce. All the other cards in the deck help you avoid or mitigate your risk of drawing an Exploding Kitten. If you don't explode, YOU WIN!

This application is my first project during the SEI course in General Assembly. It is not an official Exploding Kittens app.
