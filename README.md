I'm eager to apply my analytical and creative abilities to software development and value creation.

I am currently working on:

- Learning Java
- Learning Data Structures and Algorithm
- Revising Shoedog Project (Reference: <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/R3KFHdSDhXDEP2dcyy4HSv/ShoeDog?node-id=0%3A1&t=cmePQZLjIHfMzRKh-1" target="_blank">Shoedog Figma</a> , <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rZTL4pdaRPxEEp2aebjG9BIismeefMno/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Shoedog Data Flow</a>)

## Check out my recent work:

[ShoeDog](https://shoedog.vercel.app/) üëüüìä (In progress) <br>
Introducing ShoeDog, the revolutionary e-commerce marketplace for shoe enthusiasts. Built with the latest technologies such as ReactTS, Flask, Python, and PostgreSQL, it offers access to more than 100,000 mocked shoe listing data, real-time alerts for your favourite shoe, and the ability to track the status of those hard-to-find shoes.

[IDealify](https://idealify.vercel.app/) üè† <br>
Remodel your house in confidence. Idealify offers a hassle-free home remodelling experience. Built with MERN, it fosters trust and transparency between clients and interior designers. With our one-stop project management solution, you can remodel your home with a peace of mind.

This project exposed me to working with real-world teams with various software engineers to turn concepts into functionality.

[Nifty Stats](https://niftystats.vercel.app/) üìä
<br >
An NFT web application tool to track NFT collection statistics. Statistics feature a variety of information, including the top collections based on volume, the most recent sale transaction, the largest market capitalization, and an updated Ethereum gas tracker (gwei).

[Exploding Kittens Card Game](https://exploding-kittens-card-game.vercel.app/) üÉè
<br >
Exploding Kittens is a highly strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Basically, if you draw an Exploding Kitten, you lose and you are full of loser sad-sauce. All the other cards in the deck help you avoid or mitigate your risk of drawing an Exploding Kitten. If you don't explode, YOU WIN!

This application is my first project during the SEI course in General Assembly. It is not an official Exploding Kittens app.

[Redux To-do List](https://redux-todos-kenzothd.vercel.app/) üìù <br >
Utilized Redux toolkit to create a To-do list coded in typescript.
